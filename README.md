# WebARTesting

Hello hello people, Blyat here. 
I am testing the webAR thingy out for the project that I am working on.

I followed the guide here (https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/image-tracking/) but couldn't get it to work.
I have no idea why as it stucks at "Loading assets, please wait" so it seems to not found the models or the NFTs.
I do not have a lick of idea as to why.

Is my path wrong or do I have to use html links like the one found here (https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) 
If the latter is true, then which website should I use or is there a guide on how to host them myself? 

Any contribution to this is much appreciated.
Thank you in advance. 

BlyatifulWorld.
